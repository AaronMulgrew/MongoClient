# Mongo C data insertion
## How to install
This app assumes that the drivers for MongoDB in C have been previously installed. [available here](http://mongoc.org/)
## Running the pre built application
There is an exe [available here](https://github.com/AaronMulgrew/MongoClient/blob/master/x64/Release/MongoClient.exe) that has been pre built. The application requires the parameter of the database you would like the add the data to and the collection.
